In Akhenaten’s new religion, this figure generally came to be represented as a sun disk and is best understood as the light produced by the sun itself.  The king ascended the throne under his birth name, Amenhotep IV, but in his fifth regnal year, he changed his name to one that better reflected his religious ideas (Amenhotep = “Amun is satisfied,” Akhenaten = “Effective for Aten”). Shortly after this first significant step, Akhenaten initiated a series of changes in Egyptian religion, art and writing that appeared to coincide with the jubilees of his deified father, Amenhotep III, and the Aten.",

Among these awe-inspiring structures, the Bent Pyramid of Pharaoh Sneferu commands attention with its unique design and enigmatic history. The Dahshur Pyramids are an ancient site in Egypt, located just south of Cairo. They are one of the most famous and impressive monuments in the world, and have been a source of fascination for centuries. The Dahshur Pyramids consist of two distinct pyramids: the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid. Both were built during the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2465 BCE) under the rule of Pharaoh Sneferu, who is credited with developing the pyramid shape. The Bent Pyramid is one of the earliest examples of a true pyramid in Egypt, and is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient engineering. It is believed to have been built as a tomb for Pharaoh Sneferu, who was the first king to use stone instead of mud-brick or wood for his monuments. The Bent Pyramid stands at 105 meters tall and has two distinct sections: a lower section that rises at 54 degrees, and an upper section that rises at 43 degrees. This unique shape has earned it its name; it looks like it has been bent at its midpoint.",

        """Is was initially an obscure goddess who lacked her own dedicated temples, but she grew in importance as the dynastic age progressed, until she became one of the most important deities of ancient Egypt. Her cult subsequently spread throughout the Roman Empire, and Isis was worshipped from England to Afghanistan. She is still revered by pagans today. As mourner, she was a principal deity in rites connected with the dead; as magical healer, she cured the sick and brought the deceased to life; and as mother, she was a role model for all women.
Isis had strong links with Egyptian kingship, and she was most often represented as a beautiful woman wearing a sheath dress and either the hieroglyphic sign of the throne or a solar disk and cow’s horns on her head. Occasionally she was represented as a scorpion, a bird, a sow, or a cow. There are no references to Isis before the 5th dynasty (2465–2325 BCE), but she is mentioned many times in the Pyramid Texts (c. 2350–c. 2100 BCE), in which she offers assistance to the dead king. Later, as ideas of the afterlife became more democratic, Isis was able to extend her help to all dead Egyptians.
Isis hid with Horus in the marshes of the Nile delta until her son was fully grown and could avenge his father and claim his throne. She defended the child against attacks from snakes and scorpions. But because Isis was also Seth’s sister, she wavered during the eventual battle between Horus and Seth. In one episode Isis took pity on Seth and was in consequence beheaded by Horus (the beheading was reversed by magic). Eventually she and Horus were reconciled, and Horus was able to take the throne of Egypt.""",

        """The pyramid of Khafre or of Chephren is the middle of the three Ancient Egyptian Pyramids of Giza, the second tallest and second largest of the group. It is the only pyramid out of the three that still has cladding at the top. It is the tomb of the Fourth-Dynasty Pharaoh Khafre (Chefren), who ruled c 2558−2532 BC. 
The pyramid has a base length of 215.5 m (706 ft) or 411 cubits and rises up to a height of 136.4 metres (448 ft) or 274 cubits. It is made of limestone blocks weighing more than 2 tons each. The slope of the pyramid rises at a 53° 08' angle, steeper than its neighbor, the pyramid of Khufu, which has an angle of 51° 50' 24". Khafre's pyramid sits on bedrock 10 m (33 ft) higher than Khufu's pyramid, which makes it appear to be taller.
Like the Great Pyramid, a rock outcropping was used in the core. Due to the slope of the plateau, the northwest corner was cut 10 m (33 ft) out of the rock subsoil, and the southeast corner was built up.
The stones used at the bottom are very large, but as the pyramid rises, the stones become smaller, becoming only 50 cm (20 in) thick at the apex. The courses are rough and irregular for the first half of its height but a narrow band of regular masonry is clear in the midsection of the pyramid. At the northwest corner of the pyramid, the bedrock was fashioned into steps.[5] Casing stones cover the top third of the pyramid, but the pyramidion and part of the apex are missing.
The bottom course of casing stones was made out of pink granite but the remainder of the pyramid was cased in Tura limestone. Close examination reveals that the corner edges of the remaining casing stones are not completely straight, but are staggered by a few millimeters. One theory is that this is due to settling from seismic activity. An alternative theory postulates that the slope on the blocks was cut to shape before being placed due to the limited working space towards the top of the pyramid.[6]""",

An elegant portrait bust of Nefertiti now in Berlin is perhaps one of the most well-known ancient sculptures.
Nefertiti’s parentage is unrecorded, but, as her name translates as “A Beautiful Woman Has Come,” early Egyptologists believed that she must have been a princess from Mitanni (Syria). There is strong circumstantial evidence, however, to suggest that she was the Egyptian-born daughter of the courtier Ay, brother of Akhenaton’s mother, Tiy. Although nothing is known of Nefertiti’s parentage, she did have a younger sister, Mutnodjmet. Nefertiti bore six daughters within 10 years of her marriage, the elder three being born at Thebes, the younger three at Akhetaton (Amarna). Two of her daughters became queens of Egypt.
The earliest images of Nefertiti come from the Theban tombs of the royal butler Parennefer and the vizier Ramose, where she is shown accompanying her husband. In the Theban temple known as Hwt-Benben (“Mansion of the Benben Stone”; the benben was a cult object associated with solar ritual), Nefertiti played a more prominent role, usurping kingly privileges in order to serve as a priest and offer to the Aton. A group of blocks recovered from Karnak (Luxor) and Hermopolis Magna (Al-Ashmunayn) shows Nefertiti participating in the ritual smiting of the female enemies of Egypt.

The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt.[5] It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration. 
The pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 m (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone.[6] The step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man as of 1997,[7] although the nearby enclosure wall "Gisr el-Mudir" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary. 
Djoser is best known for his innovative tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape.[9] In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors more than a thousand years later.

His endowments and restorations of cults were recorded on what is today known as the “Restoration Stela.” The cult of the god Amun at Thebes was restored to prominence, and the royal couple changed their names to "Tutankhamun" and "Ankhesenamun", replacing the -aten suffix. He also moved the royal court from Akhenaten's capital, Amarna, back to Memphis. He reestablished diplomatic relations with the Mitanni and carried out military campaigns in Nubia and the Near East.

  Despite its fame, the origins and history of the Great Sphinx remain subjects of debate.
  In ancient Egypt, the sphinx was regarded as a spiritual guardian and was most often depicted as a male wearing a pharaoh’s headdress—such as the Great Sphinx itself. 
  These statues were frequently placed in tomb and temple complexes. One notable example is "Sphinx Alley" in Upper Egypt, 
  a two-mile avenue lined with sphinx statues that connects the temples of Luxor and Karnak.""",

    aboutMe:
        """is an ancient temple complex, originally cut into a solid rock cliff, in southern Egypt and located at the second cataract of the Nile River. The two temples which comprise the site were created during the reign of Ramesses II (c. 1279 - c. 1213 BCE) either between 1264 - 1244 BCE or 1244-1224 BCE. The discrepancy in the dates is due to differing interpretations of the life of Ramesses II by modern day scholars. It is certain, based upon the extensive artwork throughout the interior of the Great Temple, that the structures were created, at least in part, to celebrate Ramesses' victory over the Hittites at the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BCE. To some scholars, this indicates a probable date of 1264 BCE for the initial construction as the victory would have been fresh in the memory of the people. However, the decision to build the grand monument at that precise location, on the border with the conquered lands of Nubia, suggests to other scholars the later date of 1244 BCE in that it would have had to have been begun after the Nubian Campaigns Ramesses II undertook with his sons and was built as a symbol of Egypt's power.
Whichever date construction began, it is agreed that it took twenty years to create the complex and that the temples are dedicated to the gods Ra-Horakty, Ptah, and the deified Ramesses II (The Great Temple) and the goddess Hathor and Queen Nefertari, Ramesses' favourite wife (The Small Temple). While it is assumed that the name, `Abu Simbel', was the designation for the complex in antiquity, this is not so. Allegedly, the Swiss explorer Burckhardt was led to the site by a boy named Abu Simbel in 1813 CE and the site was then named after him. Burckhardt, however, was unable to uncover the site, which was buried in sand up to the necks of the grand colossi and later mentioned this experience to his friend and fellow explorer Giovanni Belzoni. It was Belzoni who uncovered and first excavated (or looted) Abu Simbel in 1817 CE and it is considered likely that it was he, not Burckhardt, who was led to the site by the young boy and who named the complex after him. As with other aspects regarding Abu Simbel (such as the date it was begun), the truth of either version of the story is open to interpretation and all that is known is that the original name for the complex, if it had a specific designation, has been lost.""",

The Great Hall is vast. It covers an acre of land, and its great columns soar to heights of 20 meters. Not only does the scale and completeness of this monument.

Sety I’s craftsmen embellished the walls and columns in the north half of the building with exquisite bas relief sculptures of the highest quality before the king’s death. Sety’s successor, the celebrated Pharaoh Ramesses II (reigned ca. 1279-1213 BCE), commanded his artisans to carve the walls and columns in its southern wing mostly in sunk relief in various phases over the course of his long reign.""",

        """The Karnak Temple is located in the ancient city of Thebes (Luxor today) in Egypt. It was a place for the ancient Egyptians to watch their gods. Karnak is an Arabic word that means ''fortified village.'' To the ancient Egyptians, Karnak was a sacred place. The Temple of Karnak was believed to be the spot where creation began. They also believed it was a point of interaction between the god Amun-Ra and Egyptians. It is important to Egypt's cultural history because it was a place of worship and provides clues about the ancient Egyptian religion. There were no libraries in ancient Thebes, so history was recorded on the walls of Karnak. Pharaohs had successful events inscribed into the walls. For instance, there are inscriptions about territory gained under Amenhotep III. There are also religious inscriptions on the walls.

The Karnak Temple was built between 2055 BC and around 100 AD. It was built as a cult temple and was dedicated to the gods Amun, Mut, and khonsu. Being the largest building for religious purposes ever to be constructed, the Karnak Temple was known as “most select of places” by ancient Egyptians.
The Karnak temple is located in Karnak, Luxor Governorate, south of Egypt on the east side of the Nile River bank.""",

In Egypt “the pharaonic land” you can find a great number of historical destinations that attract many tourists from all over the world. One of the most important cities in Egypt is Luxor
Because of the belief of the ancient Egyptians and the importance of the religion they imported to build the temples consecrated to their gods. In Luxor, there are most of the monuments of Egypt. The city of Luxor is famous for its temples because it was the ancient capital of the New Empire and is considered a great open museum. One of the important temples is the Temple of Luxor. The Temple of Luxor is considered the second largest temple in Egypt after the Temple of Karnak.

The Luxor Temple, located on the east bank of the Nile River in Luxor (ancient Thebes), is a large ancient Egyptian temple complex dating back to around 1400 BCE. Unlike other temples in Thebes, Luxor Temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, it is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the kings of Egypt were crowned.

The temple was primarily built by Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BCE) of the 18th Dynasty and completed by Tutankhamun (1336-1327 BCE) and Horemheb (1323-1295 BCE). Ramses II (1279-1213 BCE) of the 19th Dynasty also made significant additions to the temple.

The temple complex is notable for its massive pylon (gateway) built by Ramses II. The pylon is decorated with scenes of Ramses’ military expeditions, particularly his victory at the Battle of Kadesh.
The Avenue of Sphinxes, a ceremonial road flanked by sphinx statues, once connected Luxor Temple to Karnak Temple, another major temple complex in Thebes.""",
